# Panel linkages

​    ***Panel linkage*** is used to keep some items synchronized between ***plot panels***. There are currently these items available for synchronization:

- `feature`:  The feature to be plotted on the figures, metadata or feature(gene)s.
- `3D view`:  The camera position/angle of 3D scatter.
- `sample`, `embedding`: Corresponding items in ![fluent--database-multiple-20-regular](https://pic-md-1259550128.cos.ap-nanjing.myqcloud.com/fluent--database-multiple-20-regular.svg).
- `highlighting`: Cell-highlighting controlled by legend on right.

​    Each panel has a unique number, located in the top right corner of the panel. It serves as the basis for selecting the corresponding panel in the linkage.

​    When a linkage is applied (switch is on ‘ON’ mode)，![mdi--link-variant](https://pic-md-1259550128.cos.ap-nanjing.myqcloud.com/mdi--link-variant.svg)marks are used to indicate panels that have been linked together.
